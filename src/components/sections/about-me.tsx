            I&apos;m Frontend Developer passionate about creating modern,
            high-performance web applications with a strong focus on UI/UX. I
            constantly seek innovative ways to enhance user experience by
            integrating cutting-edge technologies and thoughtful design
            principles.

            <Typography>
              Since starting FPT university in 2021, Iâ€™ve actively worked on
              various personal and academic projects, constantly pushing myself
              to learn more â€” from mastering Tailwind CSS and TypeScript to
              exploring full stack tools like Next.js.
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              I love crafting clean, responsive, and user-focused interfaces.
              For me, good design is not just about how things look, but also
              how they work. Thatâ€™s why I focus on building digital products
              that are both visually appealing and technically sound.
